Certainly! Here is a sample `README.md` file for the image encryption tool:

```markdown
# Simple Image Encryption Tool

This is a simple image encryption tool implemented in Python using the Pillow library. The tool performs basic encryption by manipulating pixel values of the image.

## Features

- Encrypt an image by adding a key value to each pixel.
- Decrypt an image by subtracting the key value from each pixel.
- Simple user interface through the command line.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library

## Installation

First, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Then, install the Pillow library using pip:

```sh
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/metaphor11/simple-image-encryption.git
cd simple-image-encryption
```

2. Run the script:

```sh
python image_encryption.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions:

- To encrypt an image, select option `1`:
  - Enter the path to the image you want to encrypt.
  - Enter the path where you want to save the encrypted image.
  - Enter an integer as the encryption key.

- To decrypt an image, select option `2`:
  - Enter the path to the encrypted image.
  - Enter the path where you want to save the decrypted image.
  - Enter the same integer key used for encryption.

- To exit the program, select option `3`.

## Example

Encrypt an image:

```sh
Enter the path to the image you want to encrypt: input.jpg
Enter the path to save the encrypted image: encrypted.png
Enter the encryption key (integer): 42
Image encrypted and saved to encrypted.png
```

Decrypt an image:

```sh
Enter the path to the image you want to decrypt: encrypted.png
Enter the path to save the decrypted image: output.jpg
Enter the decryption key (integer): 42
Image decrypted and saved to output.jpg
```
